##Weather Station Project

Collecting weather data in and around campus using temperature/pressure sensors


####Team Members:
Tushar Jain, Sanjeev Khare, Merlin Sundar, Charlotte Yoder


­­­­­­­­­­­­ ####Executive Summary:
This project will involve setting up sensors of different kind around our campus and collecting the data for further future analysis. The sensors can be of various kinds like temperature, 
pressure, particulate matter, wind speed, rainfall etc. detection. There will be multiple sensors communicating with each other after every few seconds or minutes, collecting data and then going off to sleep. These sensors need not be expensive, but waterproof and preferably Wifi-enabled so that the data can be collected remotely. The data thus collected should be collected on a server or cloud base and graph plots should be displayed over the internet on a website or web­portal.

####Current state: 
Ideas have been given out. Nothing has been formulated. Plan to understand "Phant".

####Team Structure:
There should be essentially two groups. The sensor deployment and scripting team & Data collection and data plotting or analysis team. 

####Equipment needed:
Sensors­ Temperature, Pressure, Particulate Matter, Nitrogen/Oxygen/Carbon Dioxide gases, Rainfall, Wind Speed sensors.
