##Obejective
 Interfacing analog joystick and using it to control etch-a-sketch

## Observations & learnings
I learnt a lot about the analog axis of movement in the joystick and how analog inputs can be manipulated.
I combined my previously made etch-a-sketch with buttons and modified it to work with joystick.
