In Lab-02, we interfaced with LEDs and buttons.

Initially, we wired up 2 LEDs & 2 switches with 220ohm resistors.
And tried blinkled.js code from Cloud9


#####Variations
We wired up the 2 LEDs and 2 switches & tried these variations:
1. LEDv1.js: A random LED turns on with either switch is pressed. Both LEDs light up when both switches are pressed. 
2. LEDv2.js: Pressing one switch blinks an LED 10 times and then stops.
3. LEDv3.js: Pressing one switch starts an LED blinking.  Pressing another switch stops the LED from blinking.

Other variations of these experiments were also performed, such as 

Lab02 was fun and interesting, and we gained basic knowledge on how to operate basic I/O using the beaglebone. We also learnt some other things about our hardware, such as the breadboard whose power and ground rails were partitioned in half.
